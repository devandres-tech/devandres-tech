## Hi there 👋, my name is Andres Alcocer 

### I am a passionate introverted frontend developer who enjoys crafting delightful user experiences for the web. Every now and then I like to clone the frontend of my favorite web/mobile applications with React/React Native. I pay close attention to animations, ux flow, and design layout to build a coherent and functional frontend experience.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: any frontend projects inlvoving React
